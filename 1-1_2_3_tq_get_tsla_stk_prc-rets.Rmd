```{r tsla}
library(tidyquant)

# Get stock data for Tesla ( TSLA )
tsla_stock <- tq_get("TSLA", from = "2024-01-01", to = "2024-06-30")

# Calculate daily returns
tsla_returns <- tsla_stock %>% tq_transmute(select = adjusted , mutate_fun = periodReturn, period = 'daily')

head(tsla_returns, n =3)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
